# Film View Counter
Android app that lets you track how many times you've seen a film. I developed this app using Android Studio, and I used Java as my main programming language. 

I am using JUnit 4 for unit testing.

For future updates, I plan to integrate a film database API to let users search for films they want to add to their list.
